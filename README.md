Fibre Calculator

The goal of this project is to produce a basic web app with functionality which can be used to speed up the calculation process when determining if results produced when testing optical fibre are within the ranges set by your customers.

Generally these calculations are done individually using a calculator and can take some time as notes are made to ensure that each calculation is done properly, hopefully using this basic app will allow field technicians to verify their testing results more quickly.
